# Home-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Model

With the purpose to reduce the time and human costs and improve the accuracy in loan eligibility validation process, an automatic loan egibility prediction model is developed in this paper with the home loan dataset from Kaggle website, which takes a customerâ€™s demongraphic features as inputs and makes a prediction on whether a loan would be issued for that customer as outputs using machine learning techniques in R. 

This repository contains a dataset(retrieved: GOVARDHAN C. 2019. Home Loan Predictions, Version 1. Retrieved March 13, 2022 from https://www.kaggle.com/gavincanacam/home-loan-predictions) of a home loan company, a R markdown file contianing the code and a final report detailing the process of building the model. 

The structure of the project:
1. Introduction
2. Data
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Model and results
5. Discussions, weaknesses and next steps
